# GPUdb Java API Changelog

## Version 7.0

### Version 7.0.19.5 - 2021-10-29

#### Added
-   Option for automatically flushing the BulkInserter at a given delay


### Version 7.0.19.4 - 2021-10-26

#### Added
-   Option for not synchronizing requests via HA


### Version 7.0.19.3 - 2021-02-01

#### Added
-   Class `GPUdb.GPUdbVersion` that represents the Kinetica server's
    version (the one the API is connected to).
-   Method `GPUdb.getServerVersion()`.

#### Changed
-   Added support for multi-head key lookup for replicated tables.


### Version 7.0.19.2 - 2021-01-26

#### Fixed
-   An issue with BulkInserter flush when retryCount > 0


### Version 7.0.19.1 - 2020-12-23

#### Performance Enhancements
-   Converted the BulkInserter flushing mechanism from single-threaded
    to parallel-threaded.


### Version 7.0.19.0 - 2020-08-24

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.


### Version 7.0.18.1 - 2020-07-29

#### Added
-   GPUdb.Options member connectionInactivityValidationTimeout which controls
    the period of inactivity after which a connection would be checked
    for inactivity or stale-ness before leasing to a client.  The value is given
    in milliseconds.  The default value is 200 ms.  Note that this is for
    fine-tuning the connection manager, and should be used with deep
    understanding of how connections are managed.  The default value would
    likely suffice for most users; we're just letting the user have the control,
    if they want it.

#### Changed
-   The default value of GPUdb.Options member serverConnectionTimeout to 10000
    (equivalent to 10 seconds).
-   The default value of GPUdb.Options member maxConnectionsPerHost to 10.


### Version 7.0.18.0 - 2020-07-28

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.


### Version 7.0.17.1 - 2020-07-14

#### Added
-   GPUdb.Options member serverConnectionTimeout which controls the
    server connection timeout (not the request timeout).  The
    value is given in milliseconds.  The default value is 3 seconds
    (3000).


### Version 7.0.17.0 - 2020-07-01

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.


### Version 7.0.16.0 - 2020-05-28

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.



### Version 7.0.15.1 - 2020-05-02

#### Fixed
-   Socket connection timeout--now check IP/hostname availability
    for 1 second (instead of applying the user given timeout--default
    infinite--which resulted in a few minutes of hanging for bad addresses).
-   Set host manager endpoint retry count to 3 (not configurable) so that
    the API does not go into an infinite loop for a bad user given host
    manager port.


### Version 7.0.15.0 - 2020-04-27

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.



### Version 7.0.14.0 - 2020-03-25

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.



### Version 7.0.13.0 - 2020-03-10

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.

    -   GPUdb.Options.maxConnectionsPerHost (for any given host; default 40)


#### Fixed
-   Improved connection throughput over SSL.


### Version 7.0.12.0 - 2020-01-17

#### Note
-   Check CHANGELOG-FUNCTIONS.md for endpoint related changes.


### Version 7.0.9.0 - 2019-10-28

#### Added
-   Support for high-availability failover when the database is in the
    offline mode.

#### Changed
-   GPUdb constructor behavior--if a single URL is used and no primary URL
    is specified via the options, the given single URL will be treated as
    the primary URL.


### Version 7.0.8.2 - 2019-10-25

#### Fixed
-   Multi-head insertion high-availability failover issue when retryCount > 0

### Version 7.0.8.1 - 2019-10-21

#### Fixed
-   Multi-head I/O high-availability failover thread-safety issues

### Version 7.0.7.2 - 2019-10-03

#### Fixed
-   Multi-head I/O high-availability failover issue when a worker rank dies.

### Version 7.0.7.1 - 2019-09-11

#### Added
-   An option to GPUdb.Options for bypassing SSL certificate verification
    for HTTPS connections.  Obtained by and set by Options.getBypassSslCertCheck()
    and Options.setBypassSslCertCheck(boolean) methods.


### Version 7.0.7.0 - 2019-08-28

#### Added
-   Support for adding and removing custom headers to the GPUdb object.  See
    methods:
    -   GPUdb.addHttpHeader(String, String)
    -   GPUdb.removeHttpHeader(String)
-   Support for new column property 'ulong' to multi-head I/O.  ***Compatible
    with Kinetica Server version 7.0.7.0 and later only.***

#### Fixed
-   A stack overflow bug in an edge case of high availability failover for
    multi-head ingestion.

#### Server Version Compatibilty
-   Kinetica 7.0.7.0 and later


### Version 7.0.6.1 - 2019-08-13

#### Changed
-   Added support for high availability failover when the system is limited
    (in addition to connection problems).  ***Compatible with Kinetica Server
    version 7.0.6.2 and later only.***

#### Server Version Compatibilty
-   Kinetica 7.0.6.2 and later


### Version 7.0.6.0 - 2019-08-05

#### Added
-   Support for passing /get/records options to RecordRetriever; can be set
    via the constructors and also be set by the setter method.
-   Support for overriding the high availability synchronicity mode for
    endpoints; set the mode (enum HASynchronicityMode) with the setter
    method setHASyncMode():
    - DEFAULT
    - SYNCHRONOUS
    - ASYNCRHONOUS
-   Enumerations, Type.Column.ColumnType and Type.Column.ColumnBaseType,
    to indicate a column's type.  Use getters Type.Column.getColumnType()
    and Type.Column.getColumnBaseType() to obtain the appropriate enumeration.
    This is more efficient than checking for strings in the column's property
    list or checking for Java class equivalency.


#### Changed
-   Error message format when endpoint submission fails altogether (whether
    no connection can be made or if the database returns some error).


### Version 7.0.5.0 - 2019-07-21

#### Added
-   A 'putDateTime' method to GenericRecord that parses string values
    with a variety of different date, time, and datetime formats
    and converts them to the appropriate Kinetica format for the column's type.
    Of the accepteble formats, the date component can be any of YMD, MDY, or
    DMY pattern with '-', '.', or '/' as the separator.  And, the time component
    (optional for both date and datetime, but required for time) must have hours
    and minutes, but can optionally have seconds, fraction of a second (up to six
    digits) and some form of a timezone identifier.

### Version 7.0.4.0 - 2019-06-26

#### Added
-   Minor documentation and some options for some endpoints

#### Changed
-   Parameters for /visualize/isoschrone


### Version 7.0.3.0 - 2019-05-07

#### Added
-   Support for high availability (HA) to multi-head ingestion
    and retrieval

#### Changed
-   Error messages to include the original error message when Kinetica
    is unavailable and other available HA ring clusters have been tried
    (and failed).
