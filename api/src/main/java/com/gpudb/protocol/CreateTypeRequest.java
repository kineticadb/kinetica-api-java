/**
 * A set of parameters for {@link
 * com.gpudb.GPUdb#createType(CreateTypeRequest)}.
 * <p>
 * Creates a new type describing the layout or schema of a table. The type
 * definition is a JSON string describing the fields (i.e. columns) of the
 * type. Each field consists of a name and a data type. Supported data types
 * are: double, float, int, long, string, and bytes. In addition one or more
 * properties can be specified for each column which customize the memory usage
 * and query availability of that column.  Note that some properties are
 * mutually exclusive--i.e. they cannot be specified for any given column
 * simultaneously.  One example of mutually exclusive properties are {@code
 * data} and {@code store_only}.
 * <p>
 * To set a *primary key* on one or more columns include the property
 * 'primary_key' on the desired column_names. If a primary key is specified,
 * then a uniqueness constraint is enforced, in that only a single object can
 * exist with a given primary key. When {@link
 * com.gpudb.GPUdb#insertRecordsRaw(RawInsertRecordsRequest) inserting} data
 * into a table with a primary key, depending on the parameters in the request,
 * incoming objects with primary keys that match existing objects will either
 * overwrite (i.e. update) the existing object or will be skipped and not added
 * into the set.
 * <p>
 * Example of a type definition with some of the parameters::
 * <p>
 *         {"type":"record",
 *         "name":"point",
 *         "fields":[{"name":"msg_id","type":"string"},
 *                         {"name":"x","type":"double"},
 *                         {"name":"y","type":"double"},
 *                         {"name":"TIMESTAMP","type":"double"},
 *                         {"name":"source","type":"string"},
 *                         {"name":"group_id","type":"string"},
 *                         {"name":"OBJECT_ID","type":"string"}]
 *         }
 * <p>
 * Properties::
 * <p>
 *         {"group_id":["store_only"],
 *         "msg_id":["store_only","text_search"]
 *         }

     * Each key-value pair specifies the properties to use for a given column

     * names for the given table.  Specifying any property overrides the
     * default properties for that column (which is based on the column's data

     * Valid values are:
     * <ul>
     *         <li> {@link com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#DATA
     * DATA}: Default property for all numeric and string type columns; makes
     * the column available for GPU queries.
     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#TEXT_SEARCH
     * TEXT_SEARCH}: Valid only for 'string' columns. Enables full text search

     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#STORE_ONLY STORE_ONLY}:
     * Persist the column value but do not make it available to queries (e.g.

     * mutually exclusive to the 'data' property. Any 'bytes' type column must
     * have a 'store_only' property. This property reduces system memory usage.
     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#DISK_OPTIMIZED
     * DISK_OPTIMIZED}: Works in conjunction with the 'data' property for
     * string columns. This property reduces system disk usage by disabling
     * reverse string lookups. Queries like {@link

     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP}:
     * Valid only for 'long' columns. Indicates that this field represents a
     * timestamp and will be provided in milliseconds since the Unix epoch:
     * 00:00:00 Jan 1 1970.  Dates represented by a timestamp must fall between
     * the year 1000 and the year 2900.
     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#DECIMAL DECIMAL}: Valid
     * only for 'string' columns.  It represents a SQL type NUMERIC(19, 4) data
     * type.  There can be up to 15 digits before the decimal point and up to
     * four digits in the fractional part.  The value can be positive or
     * negative (indicated by a minus sign at the beginning).  This property is
     * mutually exclusive with the 'text_search' property.
     *         <li> {@link com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#DATE
     * DATE}: Valid only for 'string' columns.  Indicates that this field
     * represents a date and will be provided in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.  The
     * allowable range is 1000-01-01 through 2900-01-01.  This property is
     * mutually exclusive with the *text_search* property.
     *         <li> {@link com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#TIME
     * TIME}: Valid only for 'string' columns.  Indicates that this field

     *         <li> {@link
     * com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#NULLABLE NULLABLE}: This
     * property indicates that this column is nullable.  However, setting this
     * property is insufficient for making the column nullable.  The user must
     * declare the type of the column as a union between its regular type and
     * 'null' in the avro schema for the record type in {@code typeDefinition}.

     *         <li> {@link com.gpudb.protocol.CreateTypeRequest.Properties#DICT
     * DICT}: This property indicates that this column should be dictionary

     * the cardinality (the number of unique values) is expected to be low, and
     * can save a large amount of memory.
