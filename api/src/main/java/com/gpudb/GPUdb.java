     * target="_top">Unpivot Limitations</a>.
     * <p>
     * Unpivot is used to normalize tables that are built for cross tabular
     * reporting
     * purposes. The unpivot operator rotates the column values for all the
     * pivoted
     * columns. A variable column, value column and all columns from the source
     * table
     * except the unpivot columns are projected into the result table. The
     * variable
     * column and value columns in the result table indicate the pivoted column
     * name
     * and values respectively.
     * <p>
     * The response is returned as a dynamic schema. For details see:
     * <a href="../../../../../api/concepts/#dynamic-schemas"

     * @param tableName  Name of the table on which the operation will be
     *                   performed. Must be an existing table/view, in
     *                   [schema_name.]table_name format, using standard <a

     * @param columnNames  List of column names or expressions. A wildcard '*'
     *                     can be used to include all the non-pivoted columns
     *                     from the source table.
     * @param variableColumnName  Specifies the variable/parameter column name.
     *                            The default value is ''.

     * @param pivotedColumns  List of one or more values typically the column
     *                        names of the input table. All the columns in the
     *                        source table must have the same data type.
     * @param options  Optional parameters.

     *                   a file or directory. File matching by prefix is

     *                   must start with a full, valid KiFS directory name.

     *                   source location. Prefix matching is supported.
     *                   If the data source is hdfs, prefixes must be aligned
     *                   with directories, i.e. partial file names will not
     *                   match.

     * Runs multiple predicate-based updates in a single call.  With the

     * 'upsert'
     * capability where if a particular predicate doesn't match any existing

     * <p>
     * Note that this operation can only be run on an original table and not on
     * a

     * <p>
     * This operation can update primary key values.  By default only
     * 'pure primary key' predicates are allowed when updating primary key
     * values. If
     * the primary key for a table is the column 'attr1', then the operation
     * will only
     * accept predicates of the form: "attr1 == 'foo'" if the attr1 column is
     * being
     * updated.  For a composite primary key (e.g. columns 'attr1' and 'attr2')
     * then
     * this operation will only accept predicates of the form:
     * "(attr1 == 'foo') and (attr2 == 'bar')".  Meaning, all primary key
     * columns
     * must appear in an equality predicate in the expressions.  Furthermore
     * each
     * 'pure primary key' predicate must be unique within a given request.
     * These
     * restrictions can be removed by utilizing some available options through
     * {@code options}.
